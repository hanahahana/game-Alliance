      In a world of peace and tranquility, there stands a village at the edge of Alliance continent where all the villagers are young; No
      one ever makes it past a certain age due to a terrible plague. Once a day, evil beings will infiltrate the village, kill
      anyone in sight, and then vanish. They show no remorse or sadness, just gleeful smiles as they vicisiously slaughter men, women and children. People
      of the village are unable to leave due to large gates on the outside built by the evil beings. After many centuries, however, they become
      accustomed to their way of life. They even began to forget that there is an outside, and they tell stories of how the gates were erected.
      They've deemed the evil beings "Diety Invaders" and believe that only the chosen ones get taken. The women make as many children as possible
      to keep the village thriving while the men work the ground for food and shelter. It is a bitter sweet place, yet the villagers are all happy.
      They live each day as if it was their last cherishing every moment with each other. Until one day, the diety invaders take longer to come and
      claim the chosen ones. After months of the same behavior, the baffled villagers began to bashfully approach the gates that have been surrounding them.
      In shock, some of the villagers let out a sharp scream, while others stand speechless. What they see before them sparks a small glimmer of hope once more.
      Someone, somewhere, somehow, is fighting for them.
