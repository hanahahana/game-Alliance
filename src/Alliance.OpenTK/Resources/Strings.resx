    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="Story" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In a world of peace and tranquility, there stands a village at the edge of Alliance continent where all the villagers are young; No one ever makes it past a certain age due to a terrible plague. Once a day, evil beings will infiltrate the village, kill anyone in sight, and then vanish. They show no remorse or sadness, just gleeful smiles as they vicisiously slaughter men, women and children. People of the village are unable to leave due to large gates on the outside built by the evil beings. After many centuries, however, they become accustomed to their way of life. They even began to forget that there is an outside, and they tell stories of how the gates were erected. They've deemed the evil beings "Diety Invaders" and believe that only the chosen ones get taken. The women make as many children as possible to keep the village thriving while the men work the ground for food and shelter. It is a bitter sweet place, yet the villagers are all happy. They live each day as if it was their last cherishing every moment with each other. Until one day, the diety invaders take longer to come and claim the chosen ones. After months of the same behavior, the baffled villagers began to bashfully approach the gates that have been surrounding them. In shock, some of the villagers let out a sharp scream, while others stand speechless. What they see before them sparks a small glimmer of hope once more. Someone, somewhere, somehow, is fighting for them.</value>

  <data name="Wizard_Part1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hello! Welcome to Alliance. It is absolutely imperative that you read me and get a few details about the game! If you wish to skip me, and take the fools road down to destruction, just click "Exit" at anytime. Otherwise, keep hitting "Next".</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Wizard_Part2" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>If you didn't read the story, your job is to save the lives of citizens. If you save enough people, the citizens will grow to love you and may even help you out! However, if all the civilians die, it's game over!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Wizard_Part3" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You are stationed in the sky watching over a chunk of Alliance continent and you are armed with sky dollars (pretty sweet; I know) and an assortment of weapons (over on the right there).</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Wizard_Part4" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Right now, the invaders are far away (far far far away), but they are rapidly approaching the chunk YOU'RE supposed to be guarding. Don't worry, they can't do anything as long as I'm up (aren't you glad you didn't click 'Exit'). But once I go away, the clock will start ticking.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Wizard_Part5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You can then either challenge the invaders by using the remaining time to ectoplastransmaterport them here early, or you can wait until they arrive. Either way...look, you have cash, you have weapons. Save the citizens!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Wizard_Part6" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Oh yeah, one last thing. Pressing and holding "P" lets you view the game in "Polygon" mode. "S" sells a selected tower, "U" upgrades a selected tower (as do the buttons), "N" skips to the next wave and "Spacebar" pauses the game. What else...oh yeah. The further along you get, the smarter the invaders get.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="Wizard_Part7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>You'll be given new weapons to deal with the increasingly intelligent invaders. No one has ever completely stood off ALL of the waves of invaders, but many have at least seen the teleporting ones. YEAH: T-E-L-E-P-O-R-T-I-N-G! Anywho, you can also click and drag to place multiple weapons. It's okay to hit "Exit" now.</value>
